# nosql-challenge
Module 12 challenge

- All code was written by myself, Ryan MacFarlane - with help and guidance from the Xpert Learning Assistant, and occaisionally ChatGPT.  All code was written using Visual Studio Code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Please note - there are added code cells throughout the two Jupyter Notebooks, and I did write out a couple of *.csv files to help me keep track of what was in my collection.  There were also a couple of sections where I ended up having to deviate slightly from the instructions (like the RatingValue field).  I also added a section with the git commands I used at the end of the analysis notebook - as requested by the exercise.

- If you have any questions about any of this - please reach out to me at atlis34@yahoo.com.  Apologies for turning in late - but I have been busy and am doing my best to get caught up.

- Thank you for reading/grading!
